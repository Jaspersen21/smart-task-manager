# Smart Task Manager

## 📌 Project Purpose
This project is built to strengthen my understanding of **data structures** by applying them to a real-world task management system.

Instead of only learning theory, this system uses different data structures to manage tasks efficiently based on priority, completion status, and retrieval speed.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Lists (task storage)
- Dictionaries (fast lookup by ID)
- Heaps (priority-based task handling)
- Graph thinking (task relationships – later)
- State management (task completion & system changes)
- Big O thinking (efficiency of operations)

## ⚙️ What the System Will Do
The Smart Task Manager will allow users to:
- Add tasks
- Assign priorities
- Mark tasks as complete
- Retrieve tasks efficiently
- Handle tasks based on importance

## 🎯 Goal
To move from **"knowing data structures"** to **"using data structures to solve real problems"**, while writing clean, structured Python code like a professional developer.
